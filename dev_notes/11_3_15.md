##### Done today:
*	fetched "help-wanted" link in "worldjournal.com"

##### TODO:
*	fetch all job posting links in "worldjournal.com"
*	refactor code: use common model to handle both "craigslist" and "worldjournal"
*	add this to cron job
*	deploy to digital ocean


##### learned:
*	crawler's `filter` and `reduce` functions are very useful. I am able to filter links using regular expression with the help of `reduce`. see [document](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dom_crawler.html) for details
