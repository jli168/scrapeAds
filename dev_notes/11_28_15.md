##### Ubuntun: apache and php commands tips
*	where is apache log dir? `/var/log/apache2`, check `error.log` or `access.log`
*	how to clear `error.log`? run `>error.log` [ref](http://superuser.com/a/218221)
*	where is `php.info`? under dir `/etc/php5`, there are 2 `php.info`, one under dir `apache2`, one under dir `cli`.
*	see I want to change *timezone* setting, where is it in `php.info`? `sudo vi php.info`, search in vi is easy, type command `/` and the keyword you like, `/timezone` will do. set `date.timezone = American/New_York`

##### how to log cronjob output to file?
*	command syntax:

	```
	* * * * * myjob.sh >> /var/log/myjob.log 2>&1
	```
	will log all output from the cron job to `/var/log/myjob.log` [ref](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4811738/cron-job-log-how-to-log)
*	what does `2>&1` mean?
	File descriptor 1 is the standard output (stdout).	
	File descriptor 2 is the standard error (stderr).	
	`2>&1` combine stderr and stdout into the stdout stream. [ref](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/818255/in-the-shell-what-does-21-mean)
*	So here is my current setting for log cronjob output:
	
	```
	0 * * * * /var/www/scraper/yii scrape/crawlcl  >> /var/www/scraper/runtime/logs/cronjob.log 2>&1
	20 * * * * /var/www/scraper/yii scrape/crawlwj >> /var/www/scraper/runtime/logs/cronjob.log 2>&1
	```

##### How to detect environment in Yii2?
*	For web app, there is one elegant way to do it: set an environment variable in Apache's VirtualHost. [this post](http://stackoverflow.com/a/4809877/1369136) explains it well. And [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-apache-virtual-hosts-on-ubuntu-14-04-lts) is about set up virtual host in apache.
*	Here are the steps:
	-	`sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/crawler.conf`
	-	modify VirtualHost

		```
		<VirtualHost *:80>
			# ....
			SetEnv SERVER_CONTEXT "prod" 
		</VirtualHost>
		```
	-	update & restart apache:

		```
		sudo a2ensite crawler.conf
		sudo service apache2 restart
		```
	-	Now in php file, we can retrieve this variable by `getenv('SERVER_CONTEXT') === 'prod'`, 
		but we need to set up in the entry point of our app, so do it in `web/index.php` for web app, and `yii` for console app

*	For console app, it does not go through `web/index.php` and VirtualHost, my current way to detect environment is to use `php_uname()` function to get current machine's name and environment.  My dev machine is a scotchbox virtual box, so I use `strpos(php_uname(), 'scotchbox') !== false` to detect it. Maybe there are better solutions? I ask [this question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33979401/yii2-console-app-how-to-detect-runtime-environment) on stackoverflow.


##### How to gitignore database credentials in production server?
*	Question: My current source code is open in github, but I do not want to make production database's credentials available in source control. How to `gitignore` production db credentials?
*	Current solution: create `config/user.settings.php` file, put db credentials there, add this filename in `.gitignore` list, and merge it with db settings in `config/console.php` and  `config/web.php` 

	```php
	//config/user.settings.php

	$userSettings = [];

	switch ( YII_ENV ) {
		case 'prod':
			$userSettings = [
				'db' => [
					'username' => 'root',
					'password' => 'prod_password',
				],
			];
			break;
		case 'dev':
			$userSettings = [
				'db' => [
					'username' => 'root',
					'password' => 'dev_password',
				],
			];
			break;
		default:
			break;
	}

	return $userSettings;

	```

	```php
	// config/web.php and config/console.php

	// Include user override settings
	$userSettings = file_exists( dirname(__FILE__).'/user.settings.php' ) ?
	    require dirname(__FILE__).'/user.settings.php' : array();

	// Override db setting by user
	if( !empty( $userSettings ) && array_key_exists( 'db' , $userSettings ) ) {
	    $db = array_merge($db, $userSettings['db']);
	}
	```

##### TODO next:
*	Crawling only latest ads is kind of inefficient to gather data, I need to crawl old data, too. Also, I need to crawl more than one section.
*	Work on front end to present the ad data in a nice view. Use Backbone.js to organize js code.
*	Keep learning *Machine Learning*, look for ways to identify repeated ads, or highly similar ads. It will be fun :)
