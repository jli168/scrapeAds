##### How to efficiently reduce duplicate crawls for worldjournal?
*	Problem: Worldjournal ad front page is not like craigslist's, it has some *feature* ads on top of the ad list front page. Every time you crawl this page, you will get those *feature* ads. Now you get 100 some ad links from your crawled content, how to find the previous-not-crawled ads?

*	Previous solution: obviously you do not want to crawl each ad link, fetch ad data, and compare it against database, to decide if it is duplicate or not. But can I make an assumption that if `n` consecutive number of ad links are duplicated (by check against database), then all the following ad links are duplicated and we can stop crawling?  In this case I do not need to care about *feature* ads, as long as `n > number of feature ads`, then we are good. [code](https://github.com/njuljsong/scrapeAds/blob/a776ec8035c06583f9bacdcc7a7c7012161d1451/models/scrape/BaseModel.php):

	```php
	//$this->_existedLinkCount is the "n" number
	public function fetchAdContentsFromAdLinks( $adLinks ) {
		$posts = array();
		$alreadyFetched = 0;
		foreach ( $this->generateAdLinks( $adLinks ) as $adlink) {
			echo "adLink: ".$adlink. PHP_EOL;
			if( $this->isAdLinkCrawled( $adlink ) ) {
				if( $alreadyFetched < $this->_existedLinkCount ) {
					echo "this link is already fetched." . PHP_EOL;
					$alreadyFetched++;
					continue;
				}
				if( $alreadyFetched === $this->_existedLinkCount ){
					echo "this link and the following links are already fetched." . PHP_EOL; 
					break;
				}
			}
			
			echo "add it!" . PHP_EOL;
			
			// Reset count. Always start counting from last new ad
			$alreadyFetched = 0;
	        $posts[] = $this->fetchAdContentFromAdLink( $adlink );
		}
		
		return $posts;
	}
	```
*	Issues with previous solution: The previous solution crawls `n` extra ad links to make sure it does not miss any new ads, and we do not know how to set `n`, if `n` is less than the number of *feature* ads, then this logic will fail to fetch any new ads! Setting `n` too large is lazy.

*	Current solution: split the ads into 2 lists: feature ads list and regular ads list. In each list, the latest ads are always on top, when I iterate a list, as soon as I find *one* duplicate ad, I can stop crawling this list. Now I just need to crawl two lists instead of one, but this logic guarantees to work, and minimun overhead.

	```php
	// now the logic to find when to stop crawling is very simple
	public function fetchAdContentsFromAdLinks( $adLinks ) {
		$posts = array();
		foreach ( $this->generateAdLinks( $adLinks ) as $adlink) {
			echo "adLink: ".$adlink. PHP_EOL;
			if( $this->isAdLinkCrawled( $adlink ) ) {
				echo "this link is already fetched." . PHP_EOL;
				break;
			} else {
				echo "add it!" . PHP_EOL;
		        $posts[] = $this->fetchAdContentFromAdLink( $adlink );
			}
		}
		
		return $posts;
	}

	// crawl 2 lists in fetchAdData function
	return array_merge( 
			$this->fetchAdContentsFromAdLinks( $adLinks['featureUrls'] ), 
			$this->fetchAdContentsFromAdLinks( $adLinks['regularUrls'] )
	);

	// find and split ad links: 
	protected function fetchAdLinksFromAdCategoryCrawler( $crawler ) {
		// ...

 		return array(
 			'featureUrls' => $featureUrls,
 			'regularUrls' => $regularUrls,
 		);
	}
	```

##### So long not using jQuery...jQuery tips.
*	select direct children with tag "div": `$(this).find("> div")` [ref](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4444120/select-direct-child-of-this-in-jquery)
*	find the divs that does not have chilren with class "bar": use [`not()`](http://api.jquery.com/not/) and [`has()`](http://api.jquery.com/has/), they both have selectors
	`$("div").not(":has(.bar)")` or `$("div:not(:has(.bar))")` [ref](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10168248/if-parent-element-does-not-contain-certain-child-element-jquery)

##### Feed php generator with correct iterators.
*	If I feed a `generator` with an array that does not have index start from 0, that generator will have problem, `E_NOTICE : type 8 -- Undefined offset: 0 `. if the index 2 is skipped, `E_NOTICE : type 8 -- Undefined offset: 2 `
*	So the solution is to reindex the array, get rid of original keys. `$iZero = array_values($arr);` will do! checkout [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/591224/1369136)
*	When will array indexing not start from 0 happen? if you do `$arr = array_diff($arr1, $arr2)`, `$arr`'s index is not from 0.


##### `less` command tip:
*	How to jump to the end of file? `shift + g` will take you to the bottom of the file.
*	Also, `tail -10 infile` will show you the last 10 lines of `infile`
