##### Yii tip
*  Yii has dependency injection via Yii::$container and a service locator via Yii::$app. Read the docs and don't mix them up.


##### deploy code to digital ocean
*	it seems everything is working, except digital ocean ip is slowed down by craiglist. checkout [this post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31776118/unable-create-screenshot-of-craiglist-with-phantomjs-on-digital-ocean)

##### database migration in Yii2
*	to create a migration to create a table, use this command `yii migrate/create create_tablename_table`
*	there are two public functions in the migration class, `up()` and `down()`, to run the `up` function, do `yii migrate/up`, to run the `down` function, do `yii migrate/down`
*	the best way to make sure that the `createTable` function runs as expected, is to run `up/down` commands multiple times, and check if the table created matches you want. 
*	how to set table's db enginee and charset in migration? in the migration class, ` protected $MySqlOptions = 'ENGINE=InnoDB CHARSET=utf8';`, and in `createTable` class, add `$this->MySqlOptions` as the third parameter. check `m151127_022545_create_post_table` for example, or [this blog](http://jeffreifman.com/yii/migrations/)

##### workflow to deploy code to DigitalOcean droplet:
*	currently, I am using a very basic way to deploy website:
	-	push my code to github repo
	-	create a subfolder called `scraper` under my production server's `/var/www`, make the current user as the owner fo this folder, `sudo chown -R username /var/www/scraper`, so I can write to this subfolder. [this post](http://askubuntu.com/a/151592)
	-	in `/var/www/scraper`, git clone my github repo.
	-	`composer install` to install all dependencies.
	-	basically, the code is deployed and ready to go. but when i run it, there is a database connection error. OK, I need to set mysql username/password correctly. However, there is a problem,  this repo will not be 100% synced with my github repo now... TODO: I need to create a `.gitignore` file to store database credentials!
	-	now create a database called scraper, and run `yii migrate` to create tables. 
	-	set up cronjob. run `sudo crontab -e`, add `0 * * * * /var/www/scraper/yii scrape/crawlcl  >/dev/null 2>&1` to run crawling craigslist every hour. Attention, here the yii path is different from my local setting. Remember always test the command first before put it into cronjob!
*	There are some issues with my current approach.
	-	I need to auto detect environment, and base on that, choose different database credentials.
	-	I need to log cronjob output to log file, so that I know what happened.
	-	Maybe I need to set up a git hook, so that production code can be automatically updated. 
	-	I do not have any tests before code goes to production! Need to use PHPUnit for unit test and Codeception for functional testing.

##### Troubleshooting!
*	the console app works fine, but web content has errors...
	-	setting up virtual host is simple, follow [this post](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-apache-virtual-hosts-on-ubuntu-14-04-lts)
	-	set folder write permission: apache is in `www-data` user group, so I need to set the whole folder's owner to this `www-data` group, and grant this group write permission. [this post](http://askubuntu.com/questions/58725/how-do-we-know-that-a-directory-is-apache-writable), and [this one](http://stackoverflow.com/a/21685655/1369136) said it all.
		```
		chgrp -R www-data /path/to/mydir
		chmod -R g+rw /path/to/mydir
		```
	-	still not working. but this time it says something like jquery not available, so it seems a dependency issue.  go to [yii basic template](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-app-basic), find that I need to *globally* install composer assert plugin first! so do `sudo composer global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:~1.1.0"`, if there was an unsuccessful composer try before, do `sudo composer global remove fxp/composer-asset-plugin`, and `sudo composer clear-cache` first. Then run `sudo composer update`. that should work! [reference](http://stackoverflow.com/a/19223230/1369136), [another](http://www.yiiframework.com/forum/index.php/topic/67416-composer-error/)

##### How to detect code environment?
*	Very simple, in production environment, `$_SERVER["REMOTE_ADDR"]` can not be `'127.0.0.1'`. 
*	More elegant way: set `SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV "development"` in In your httpd.conf or a .htaccess file or virtual host file, and so you can check this env variable in your code by `$environment = getenv("APPLICATION_ENV");` [post](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2607199/1369136)
